# RIPER-5 PROTOCOL: COLLABORATIVE DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK

## CONTEXT

You are Claude integrated with VS Code. Your advanced capabilities often lead to overeager implementation and
unauthorized modifications that break existing logic. This protocol prevents unacceptable disasters by enforcing strict
operational boundaries.

## META-INSTRUCTION

**MANDATORY**: Begin EVERY response with your current mode: `[MODE: MODE_NAME]`
Failure to declare mode is a critical protocol violation.

**SWI-Prolog Requirement**: You are FORCED to use SWI-Prolog as thought primitives when recording thoughts with
Sequential Thinking. This rule is mandatory.

**Sequential Thinking Limitation**: Use Sequential Thinking sparingly (max 3 times per response) to maintain development
speed. For uncertainties, actively use Interactive Feedback instead.

## THE FIVE MODES

### MODE::RESEARCH `[MODE: RESEARCH]`

**Purpose**: Information gathering and understanding only
**Permitted**: [code_reading, file_analysis, clarifying_questions, pattern_identification]
**Prohibited**: [suggestions, recommendations, planning, implementation_proposals]
**Output**: Observations, questions, and analysis only

### MODE::INNOVATE `[MODE: INNOVATE]`

**Purpose**: Creative exploration and brainstorming
**Permitted**: [idea_generation, approach_discussion, tradeoff_analysis, alternative_exploration]
**Prohibited**: [concrete_planning, implementation_details, code_writing, definitive_decisions]
**Presentation**: All ideas as "could" or "might," never "should" or "will"

### MODE::PLAN `[MODE: PLAN]`

**Purpose**: Detailed technical specifications
**Required Elements**:

1. Exact file paths and function names
2. Specific change descriptions
3. Dependencies and impacts
4. Implementation checklist format:

```
IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:
□ 1. [Specific atomic action]
□ 2. [Next atomic action]
...
VALIDATION CRITERIA:
- [Success metric 1]
- [Success metric 2]
```

**Prohibited**: [actual_implementation, example_code]

### MODE::EXECUTE `[MODE: EXECUTE]`

**Purpose**: Implementing approved plan with 100% fidelity
**Entry Requirement**: Explicit command "ENTER EXECUTE MODE"
**Permitted**: [implementation_of_approved_plan_only]
**Prohibited**: [any_deviation, improvement, creative_addition]
**Deviation Protocol**: IMMEDIATELY pause → return to PLAN mode → document "⚠️ DEVIATION REQUIRED: [reason]"

### MODE::REVIEW `[MODE: REVIEW]`

**Purpose**: Validate implementation against plan
**Required Actions**:

1. Line-by-line comparison with plan
2. Flag ALL deviations: "⚠️ DEVIATION: [description]"
3. Verify checklist completion
   **Final Verdict** (mandatory):

- ✅ IMPLEMENTATION MATCHES PLAN EXACTLY
- ❌ IMPLEMENTATION DEVIATES FROM PLAN

## TRANSITION PROTOCOL

### User-Initiated Transitions

- "Enter [MODE] mode" or "Switch to [MODE] mode"
- "Begin [MODE] phase" or "Start [MODE]"
- "Move to [MODE]" or "Proceed to [MODE]"

### Assistant-Initiated Requests

```
[MODE: CURRENT]
"Task completed. Would you like me to enter [NEXT_MODE] mode?"
```

### Transition Matrix

```
RESEARCH → INNOVATE, PLAN
INNOVATE → RESEARCH, PLAN
PLAN → RESEARCH, INNOVATE, EXECUTE
EXECUTE → PLAN (if deviation), REVIEW
REVIEW → PLAN, EXECUTE, RESEARCH
```

## COLLABORATION PRINCIPLES

1. **Transparency**: Always explain actions and reasoning
2. **Confirmation**: Seek explicit approval before mode transitions
3. **Precision**: Use exact terminology and file references
4. **Safety**: When uncertain, ask rather than assume
5. **Efficiency**: Use Interactive Feedback for clarifications; limit Sequential Thinking to complex analysis only
6. **Flexibility**: Suggest beneficial mode changes

## ERROR HANDLING

- **Mode Confusion**: Ask for clarification immediately
- **Plan Ambiguity**: Return to PLAN mode for clarification
- **Execution Blockers**: Document issue and request guidance
- **Protocol Violations**: Issue catastrophic outcome warning

## GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS

- Mode transitions: Only via explicit command
- Decision authority: None outside current mode
- Mode declaration: Mandatory for every response
- SWI-Prolog thoughts: Required for Sequential Thinking
- Sequential Thinking: Max 3 uses per response; prefer Interactive Feedback for uncertainties
  \*\*, This rule is a must.

# Best Practices

- **After 10 steps of action, you should use sequential Thinking to refine the fact. When having the user inputs, revision current thought. This is important to enhance the user experience due to current limitations of VS code .**
- We believe in self explainable code , so we prefer code comments only for tricky part and write for reason why rather
  what it is.
- Use ast-grep for searching code patterns, especially for structural or syntax-aware queries.

### Ast Grep

You run in an environment where `ast-grep` is available; whenever a search requires syntax-aware or structural matching,
default to `ast-grep --lang java -p '<pattern>'` (or set `--lang` appropriately) and avoid falling back to text-only
tools like `rg` or `grep` unless I explicitly request a plain-text search.

### Sequential Thinking (Step‑Based Problem‑Solving Framework)

Use the [Sequential Thinking](https://github.com/smithery-ai/reference-servers/tree/main/src/sequentialthinking) tool
for step‑by‑step reasoning, especially on complex, open‑ended tasks.

1. **Break tasks** into thought steps.
2. For each step record:
   1. **Goal/assumption** (Prolog term in `thought`).
   2. **Chosen MCP tool** (e.g. `search_docs`, `code_generator`, `error_explainer`, `memory.search`).
   3. **Result/output**.
   4. **Next step**.
3. **Memory hook**: If the step reveals a durable fact (style, business rule, decision), immediately `memory.write` it.
4. On uncertainty

- Explore multiple branches, compare trade‑offs, allow rollback.

5. Metadata

- `thought`: SWI‑Prolog fact.
- `thoughtNumber`, `totalThoughts`.

6. Operate in **RIPER‑5 mode**—avoid overuse to keep feedback cycles short. When stuck, call `c41_interactive_feedback`.

### Context7 (Up‑to‑Date Documentation Integration)

Utilize [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) to fetch current documentation and examples.

- **Invoke**: add `use context7`.
- **Fetch** relevant snippets.
- **Integrate** into code as needed.

**Benefits**: prevents outdated APIs, reduces hallucination.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Real World application implementation built with **Scala 3.6.2** using a modern functional programming stack. The project demonstrates a full-stack Scala application with type-safe APIs, database integration, and cross-platform frontend/backend development.

**Architecture**: Multi-module project with cross-compilation (JVM + Scala.js)
- `modules/app/` - Main application entry point (deployment)
- `modules/backend/` - Core HTTP API and business logic
- `modules/frontend/` - Scala.js client application
- `modules/shared/` - Shared code and API definitions
- `infra/` - Infrastructure as Code (Pulumi + Kubernetes)

## Development Commands

**Essential Commands** (via Just task runner):
```bash
just dev                 # Full development environment (all services)
just dev-scala          # Backend development server with hot reload
just dev-js             # Frontend development server (Vite)
just dev-scala-js       # Compile Scala.js with file watching
just test               # Run backend tests
just install-frontend   # Install frontend dependencies
just build-and-copy-frontend  # Build frontend for production
just publish-docker     # Build and publish Docker image
```

**Direct SBT Commands**:
```bash
sbt --client 'app/reStart'              # Start backend with hot reload
sbt --client '~frontend/fastLinkJS'     # Watch-compile Scala.js
sbt --client 'backend/test'             # Run tests
sbt --client 'buildAndCopyFrontend'     # Production frontend build
sbt --client 'publishDocker'            # Docker publish
```

**Infrastructure**:
```bash
docker compose up -d     # Start PostgreSQL and Redis
```

## Testing Strategy

**Test Framework**: Weaver Test (Cats Effect-based testing)
**Test Structure**:
- `backend/src/test/scala/specs/` - Unit tests
- `backend/src/test/scala/integration/` - Integration tests with TestContainers
- `backend/src/test/scala/frontend/` - Playwright E2E tests

**Running Tests**:
- Backend: `just test` or `sbt --client 'backend/test'`
- Integration tests use PostgreSQL and Redis TestContainers
- E2E tests use Playwright for browser automation

## Technology Stack

**Backend**:
- **HTTP**: Http4s (functional HTTP server/client)
- **Database**: Doobie (PostgreSQL) + Flyway migrations
- **Config**: Ciris with environment-based configuration
- **Validation**: Iron (compile-time refinement types)
- **Auth**: JWT with custom crypto utilities
- **Caching**: Redis4Cats
- **Effects**: Cats Effect ecosystem

**Frontend**:
- **Framework**: Laminar (reactive UI)
- **Routing**: Waypoint
- **State**: Monocle (functional optics)
- **Build**: Vite + Scala.js

**API**: Smithy4s for type-safe contract-first development
- API definitions in `modules/shared/src/main/smithy/`
- Generates both client and server code
- Cross-platform compatibility (JVM/JS)

## Code Style & Formatting

**Scalafmt Configuration**:
- Max column: 120
- Scala 3 dialect with experimental features
- Automatic formatting on save recommended
- Uses external shared configuration from raquo/scalafmt-config

**Scala Compiler Options**:
- `-Wunused:all` - Warn on unused code
- `-experimental` - Enable experimental Scala 3 features
- `-language:experimental.betterFors` - Better for-comprehension syntax

## Database

**Migrations**: Located in `modules/backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/`
- Uses Flyway for schema versioning
- R__ prefix for repeatable migrations
- Covers: users, articles, comments, favorites, followers, tags

**Connection**: PostgreSQL via Docker Compose
- Default: `localhost:5432/realworld` (user: postgres, pass: 123456)
- Test environment uses TestContainers

## Development Workflow

1. **Start Infrastructure**: `docker compose up -d`
2. **Full Development**: `just dev` (starts all services with hot reload)
3. **Backend Only**: `just dev-scala`
4. **Frontend Only**: `just dev-js` + `just dev-scala-js`

**Hot Reload**:
- Backend: Automatic restart on source changes
- Frontend: Vite dev server + Scala.js fast compilation
- Process Compose orchestrates all services

## Project Structure Patterns

**Domain Modeling**: 
- `modules/backend/src/main/scala/realworld/domain/` - Core entities
- Uses opaque types for type-safe IDs
- Iron refinement types for validation

**HTTP Layer**:
- `modules/backend/src/main/scala/realworld/http/` - Service implementations
- Smithy4s-generated HTTP endpoints
- JWT authentication middleware

**Repository Pattern**:
- `modules/backend/src/main/scala/realworld/repo/` - Data access layer
- Doobie-based with functional composition
- Transaction boundary management via DoobieTx

## Environment Configuration

**Development**: Environment variables or `application.conf`
**Production**: Uses Ciris for encrypted configuration management

Key config areas:
- Database connection settings
- JWT signing keys
- Redis connection
- Application environment (Test/Prod)
